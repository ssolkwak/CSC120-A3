- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    It seemed a little overwhelming at first to get used to the built in classes and forms of methods but once figured out it was much more convinient to write an oop in java than in python. Once I get more comfortable with oop I think it could get more versatile. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
    Different languages are specialized for different purposes, and while having much more freedom with dynamic typing in python is great, sometimes it is more straightforward to utilize what's already built in for java. I think Java could be much more useful for larger scale projects and python is great for quick programming as it can be done with somewhat spontaneous planning. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Using Map to store String pairs of original mirror word and its replacement worked. I tried to iterate by each entry of the Map which didn't work well for some reason, so I changed to iterate by keys. Returning random response when needed worked well. I wasn't sure how to work with punctuations or I/me dilemma. Office hours were super helpful for evaluating new ideas to try. I would recommend that if one comes up with an idea, even if it's random and abstract, go to office hours or talk to peers because they can help you make that idea more concrete.
