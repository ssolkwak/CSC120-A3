- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    It seemed a little overwhelming at first to get used to the built in classes and forms of methods but once figured out it was much more convinient to write an oop in java than in python. Once I get more comfortable with oop I think it could get more versatile. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
    Different languages are specialized for different purposes, and while having much more freedom with dynamic typing in python is great, sometimes it is more straightforward to utilize what's already built in for java. I think Java could be much more useful for larger scale projects and python is great for quick programming as it can be done with somewhat spontaneous planning. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I was able to do simple replacements of mirror words but I wonder how to differentiate some exceptions or confusions with some of the words depending on the user input. I also wasn't sure how to detect and replace words case sensitive/insensitive. My code works but I would like to know a better, cleaner way to organize it, espcially the mirror words part. Peer discussions difinitely helped.
